Core Problem
Retail store managers and supply chain executives face a constant "optimization dilemma" concerning sales forecasting:

Under-stocking: Leads to stockouts, immediate lost revenue, and long-term damage to customer loyalty.
Over-stocking: Results in inflated inventory costs, potential waste (especially for perishable goods), and profit erosion due to clearance discounts. Sales fluctuations are complex, influenced by non-linear interactions of time (weekends, holidays), location, store attributes, and marketing interventions (discounts).
Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust Machine Learning Regression Model. This model will be capable of predicting future sales for specific retail outlets by analyzing historical transaction data to learn patterns and relationships between sales figures and various independent variables.

Expected Outcomes & Business Value
The successful deployment of this forecasting model is expected to provide significant business value by addressing the following needs:

Inventory Optimization: Ensuring the right amount of stock is available at the right store at the right time.
Revenue Projection: Assisting finance teams in accurately estimating future cash flows.
Resource Allocation: Helping management make informed decisions on staffing levels and logistics support during predicted peak periods.
Marketing Strategy: Identifying which store types and regions respond best to promotions, thereby enabling more targeted marketing campaigns.
